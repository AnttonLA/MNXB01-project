##Usage

As of now, the way I've been running the functions is the following

    root
    tempTrender* test_2 = new tempTrender("../datasets/smhi-opendata_1_162870_20210926_101011_Lulea.csv")
    test_2->tempOnDay(1,2)

Make sure to include the local path to your include/ directory in the rootlogon.C file for it to work!
