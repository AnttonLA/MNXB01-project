\subsection{tempOnDay()}
The first of the proposed graphs was a histogram that will show all the temperatures recorded over the years for a single day. The member function of tempTrender that deoes this was called "tempOnDay()".\par
There are two variants proposed for the tempOnDay member function in the instructions file: one that takes two int values as input (month and day) and one that takes a number between 0 and 365, corresponding to a specific day of the year. We implemented both.\par
Data parsing was done by skipping the headers of the files and then reading all of the rest of the lines. If the date of a line corresponded with the desired date, the value for that date was included into the histogram. No data pre-processing was done.
